# Time Bins for Classification (tbins)

Time bins for classification of categorical information encoded in point processes using ensembles of gradient boosted decision trees.

The reader is encouraged to verify, interpret, and extend the methods presented in the [example notebook](https://github.com/timtyree/tbins/blob/main/notebooks/decoding_individual_identity.ipynb), which produced the [example output](https://github.com/timtyree/tbins/blob/main/doc/decoding_individual_identity.pdf).  
In the example notebook, the reader may click on a file comparable to the [example dataset](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfkv), which was used to generate the following recievwer operator characteristic (ROC) traces:
